#Data Structures 

* Includes implementation of some of the most common data structures with specific algorithmic operations.
* List Currently includes implementation of  

	* ##Linked List (C++)
		* **Mth Node from end without explicitly knowing the size of list.**
		* **To find if the given linked list is cyclic/circular.**
		
	* ##Linked List (C)
	* ##Doubly Linked List (C)
	* ##Generic Tree (Java)
	
	* ##Binary Search Tree (Java)
		* **Recursive calculation of Tree Height**
		* **Non Recursive Traversals (Pre Order)**
		* **Find Lowest Common Ancestor (Non-Recursive)**
		* **Reorder Tree Into Heap(Min) (Via Array)**
		* **Find Successor of given node (Non-Recursive)**
		* **Find Predecessor of a given node (Non-Recursive)**
		* **Remove Node and rearrange the tree**
		* Find node with given value (Non-Recursive)
		* Find node with minimum value (Recursive)
		* Recursive Traversals (Pre Order)
		
 	* ##Priority Queue - Max (C++)
#To Do
* Implement Recursive versions of Non-Recurisve methods
