#Data Structures 

* Includes implementation of some of the most common data structures with specific algorithmic operations.

* List Currently includes implementation of  
	* Linked List (C++)
		* Mth Node from end without explicitly knowing the size of list.
		* To find if the given linked list is cyclic/circular
		
	* Generic Tree (Java)
	
	* Binary Search Tree (Java)
		* Recursive calculation of Tree Height
		* Recursive Traversals (Pre Order)
		* Non Recursive Traversals (Pre Order)
		* Find node with given value (Non-Recursive)
		* Find Lowest Common Ancestor (Non-Recursive)
		* Reorder Tree Into Heap(Min) (Via Array)
#To Do
* Implement Recursive versions of Non-Recurisve methods
